## Overview
Reviewing temperature trends before opening surf shop.
Analyzing data for the months of June and December in Oahu to to make
sure that surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.

### Results
* The mean temperature between June (74.94) and December (71.04) was 72.99
* The minimum temperature in June was 64.00 and minimum for December was 56.00 for a difference of 8.00.
* The maximum temperature in June was 85.00 and maximum for December was 83.00 for a difference of 2.00.

## Summary
With data provided for the start of the hot month of June and cold month of December, the temperatures
don't seem to be a huge factor. Even when breaking down the percentiles. 
25% = 73(J) and 69(D)
50% = 75(J) and 71(D)
75% = 77(J) and 74(D)
The data currently isn't substantial enough to say that the surf and ice cream shop couldn't be sustainable
for June and December. For further analysis maybe check the hottest time of year vs coldest time of year.
For further analysis maybe check the hottest time of year vs coldest time of year.
I'd also recommend checking the busiest time of year compared to the slowest. If you don't have enough
people there visiting the surf and ice cream shop that could impact success more than the weather.
